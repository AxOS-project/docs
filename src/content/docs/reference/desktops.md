AxOS has 3 default desktops. Learn more about them in this reference page.

## Plasma

Plasma (or KDE Plasma) is the default desktop environment for AxOS. It is a powerful, user-friendly, stable and customizable desktop environment.

As it is a very known and active desktop environement, you can find everything you need on Internet.

| Pros               | Cons                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Active community   | Not the most resource-efficient     |
| Very customizable  | Not the most aesthetic and original |
| Stable             |                                     |
| User-friendly      |                                     |

## Calla

Calla (made by [Stardust-kyun](https://github.com/Stardust-kyun)) is the second desktop environment for AxOS. It is a lightweight and ressource efficient desktop environment. 

Calla is a tiling window manager, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. It is also better if used with keybindings, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. You can find them by pressing `Super + F1`. If you need, you can change some settings (including keybindings) by editing the `/usr/share/calla/desktop/config/bind.lua` file.

| Pros               | Cons                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Lightweight        | Hard to (fully) use                 |
| Tiling             | Less stable than Plasma             |
| Resource-efficient | Less features than other desktops   |

## Sleex

Sleex (based on Hyprland) is the third desktop environment for AxOS. It is the most aesthetic and feature-rich desktop environment of the 3. It has a lot of features, smooth animations and a lot of cool stuff, but it is also the least stable.

Like Calla, it is a tiling window manager, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. It is also better if used with keybindings, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. You can find them by pressing `Super + F1`. If you need, you can change some settings (including keybindings) by editing files in  `.config/hypr/hyprland/` folder. You can change the wallpaper by pressing `Super + T`.

**By default, the keyboard layout is set to US QWERTY, no matter what you chosed in the installation. You can change it by editing the `.config/hypr/hyprland/general.conf` file.**
