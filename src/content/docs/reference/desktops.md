AxOS has 4 default desktops. Learn more about them in this reference page.

## Sleex

Sleex (based on the Hyprland compositor) is the third and primary desktop environment for AxOS. It is the most aesthetic and feature-rich desktop environment of the 3. It has a lot of features, smooth animations and a lot of cool stuff.

It is a tiling window manager, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. It is also recommended to use keybindings for a better experience and productivity. You can find them by pressing `Super + F1`. A settings app is included, and can be opened either by pressing `Super + I` or by clicking the gear button on the dashboard.

## Calla

Calla (made by [Stardust-kyun](https://github.com/Stardust-kyun)) is the second desktop environment for AxOS. It is a lightweight and resource efficient desktop environment.

Calla is a tiling window manager, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. It is also better if used with keybindings, so you can manage your windows with a keyboard. You can find them by pressing `Super + F1`. If you need, you can change some settings (including keybindings) by editing the `/usr/share/calla/desktop/config/bind.lua` file.

## Theom

Theom is the fourth desktop environment for AxOS. It is made for ease of use, minimalism and customisability.

Theom is based on the i3 window manager, so you can control it with a keyboard. You can view the keybindings at [theom documentation page](https://www.axos-project.com/docs/guides/theom/) or by using the `cheetsheet` which you can open by pressing `Super + F1`. You can customise theom by editing the `~/.config/theom/config.toml` file but it is better to use the `theom settings` application instead. You can view your system specs and other information via `theom dashboard`. You can open it by pressing `Super + Shift + D`
